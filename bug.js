This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the `cameraRef` before it's fully mounted or initialized.  This often happens in componentDidMount or useEffect hooks.  The `cameraRef` might be null or undefined at that time, leading to a TypeError or similar runtime error.  Asynchronous operations with the camera (like setting up permissions) may not have completed.
